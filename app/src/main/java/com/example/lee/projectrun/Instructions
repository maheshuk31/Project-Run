ooVooSdkSampleApp activity was the launcher activity of the sample.
It does not have a layout of its own, only settings on the video chat along
with the settings bar and its functions.



LoginFragment is technically the first activity called out, all the fragments
can be viewed as actual activities.



ApplicationSettings and oovoo account has been verified and completed, Token is unique to us, do NOT
change anything in the class, everything is dynamic and changes with the app running.



Currently cannot resolve:
import com.oovoo.sdk.oovoosdksampleshow.R;
as it is "missing"...
