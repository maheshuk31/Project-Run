*** VIDEO-CHAT ***

ooVooSdkSampleApp activity was the launcher activity of the sample.
It does not have a layout of its own, only settings on the video chat, it contains all the methods
on firing the application across all classes.



LoginFragment is technically the first activity called out, all the fragments
can be viewed as actual activities.



ApplicationSettings and oovoo account has been verified and completed, Token is unique to us, do NOT
change anything in the class, everything is dynamic and changes with the app running.



Currently cannot resolve:
- import com.oovoo.sdk.oovoosdksampleshow.R;
- How each fragment is opened from one fragment/activity to another.
as it is "missing"...
